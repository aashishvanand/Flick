# Flick
Udacity Android Nanodegree - Popular Movies 2 <br>
This is a Android app to show all your favourite movies, details and trailers based on several catagories like Rating, Popularity, Revenue, Now Playing and User Favourites.
I have tried to implement the whole project on the material guidelines from google by using Material Colours, Material Cards.
